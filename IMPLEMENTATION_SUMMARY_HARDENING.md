### 4. E2E Integration Test

**Location**: `apps/server/test/e2e/orch-ai-comm.e2e.test.ts`

**Tests** (5 scenarios):
1. ✓ Complete full orchestration → AI workflow within 2s
2. ✓ Handle AI generation with metadata tracking

4. ✓ Verify message bus integrity during workflow
5. ✓ Complete complex multi-step AI workflow

**Execution Time**: < 650ms (well within 2s requirement)

- MemoryBus integration
- CommAdapter message routing
- Orchestrator workflow execution

   - New messages signed with key-v2
   - Old messages still verifiable via getById

2. ✓ Handle graceful key deprecation
   - Deprecate old key (keep for verification)
   - Remove after grace period
   - Demonstrates 24h grace period pattern

**Security**: Proves HMAC signature verification works across key rotations, critical for zero-downtime key management.
